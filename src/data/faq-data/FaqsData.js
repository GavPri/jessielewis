    question: "What does each session entail?",
    answer:
      "Each session lasts around 30 minutes and is tailored to the client's individual needs and goals. Following a free consultation to see if the mental performance coach and client are a good fit, the cost of mental skills training varies depending on the clients goals, needs, and financial situation. While each session may look different depending on the client, sessions tend to center around topics such as mindfulness, self-confidence, goal setting, self-talk, arousal regulation techniques, breathing techniques, emotion regulation, etc.",

    question:
      "When is a good time to start working with a mental performance coach?",
    answer:
      "Working with a mental performance coach shouldn’t only be driven by a deficit approach, implying a lack in performance that leads to seeking mental training expertise. Instead, the focus should be on utilizing mental skills training to enhance an athlete’s existing performance. This approach aims to build upon strengths and elevate overall capabilities, fostering a proactive perspective towards mental skills development.",

    question:
      "How can you measure your progress working with a mental performance coach?",
    answer:
      "The evaluation of mental skills training extends beyond mere performance outcomes. While performance is a crucial aspect, progress can be measured through regular self-check-ins to assess adherence to our process goals. Additionally, feedback from teammates, coaches, and the broader team offers insights into how well we are managing our emotions and stress levels. A top performer cannot be the best on their own; it requires a strong support system. Having a reliable support system ensures individuals have a foundation to lean on and remain accountable for their ongoing growth and success.",

    question: "Are these sessions specifically for elite athletes?",

      "These sessions are not meant for just elite athletes. Rather, mental skills training can be useful for anyone in performance settings whether that is for athletes, musicians, firemen, public speakers, businessmen, you name it. The goal is for clients to utilize these mental skills in high-pressured situations to optimize performance and presence in all facets of their life.",
